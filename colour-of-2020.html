	<h1>Colour of the Year 2020: Classic Blue</h1>

	<p>The votes have been counted, the results are in, and we have a winner: the choice of Colour of the Year 2020 goes to <a href="https://www.pantone.com/color-intelligence/color-of-the-year/color-of-the-year-2020" target="_blank">Classic Blue</a>, a shade somewhere between royal blue and navy. Or, as expressed in the six-character hexadecimal code used by web designers and front-end developers, #004680.</p> 

	<p>Every twelve months, Pantone, creators of the world&#8217;s most widely-used colour identification system, delivers its verdict on what colour will best catch the mood of the year ahead.</p>

	</picure>

	
	<p>It is a measure of the company&#8217;s influence on visual culture that its latest annual choice attracted attention in places as diverse as <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/pantone-color-classic-blue-2020/index.html" target="_blank">CNN</a> and <a href="https://time.com/5744039/pantone-color-of-the-year-2020/"><em>Time</em></a>, New York&#8217;s <a href="https://mymodernmet.com/pantone-color-of-the-year-2020/">Metropolitan Museum of Art</a>, the UK&#8217;s <a href="https://www.homesandproperty.co.uk/home-garden/interiors/design-news/pantone-colour-of-the-year-2020-classic-blue-a135801.html" target="_blank">Homes & Property</a> website, and the <em>Net</em> magazine&#8217;s <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/news/pantone-colour-of-the-year-2020-announced" target="_blank">Creative Blog</a>. All evidence of Pantone&#8217;s pervasive influence across sectors that include fashion, home furnishings, product packaging and, of course, web and mobile front-end design.</p>

	<p>Software developers <a href="https://theblog.adobe.com/pantone-color-of-the-year-2020/" target="_blank">Adobe</a> greeted the choice as <em>&#8220;a welcome refuge for our uncertain era ... Blue hues, long associated with peace, calm, and the dependable daylight sky, feel solid and reliable.&#8221;</em> The creators of Photoshop even put together a short video to celebrate the <em>&#8220;constancy and comfort that Classic Blue offers us.&#8221;</em></p>

	<p>Not everyone is a fan, however. <em>&#8220;Awful, forgettable, pedestrian&#8221;</em>, complained US technology and business magazine <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90443036/pantones-color-of-the-year-is-awful" target="_blank">Fast Company</a>. Also unimpressed was the London-based <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/2019/12/10/classic-blue-pantone-colour-of-the-year/" target="_blank">Dezeen</a>, the world&#8217;s most popular and influential journal of architecture: <em>&#8220;Pantone played it safe and still missed the mark&#8221;</em> was their verdict on what it condemned as a <em>&#8220;depressingly cynical&#8221;</em> choice.</p>

	<h2>The world&#8217;s favourite colour</h2>
	<p>Research in recent decades has confirmed what Dublin GAA supporters have always believed: <a href="https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-blue-worlds-favorite-color" target="_blank">blue is the world&#8217;s favourite colour.</a> In <a href="https://99designs.ie/blog/tips/colors-marketing-advertising/" target="">marketing and advertising</a>, it has long been the go-to choice for  organisations who want to promote trust in their products and services &#8211; and generally convey a sense of dependability, sincerity, and calm competence.</p>
	
	<p>Take a look at the websites and mobile apps of many of the world&#8217;s top IT brands. In terms of colour, the sight is not too different from Croke Park&#8217;s Hill 16 on All-Ireland Sunday.</p>

	<h2>A reassuring backdrop in changing times</h2>

	<p>As you can see from the image below, Pantone&#8217;s selection of Classic Blue for 2020 marks a departure from its choices of recent years.</p>

	<p>But it also represents a return to the company&#8217;s very first Colour of the Year, announced in the final month of the last millennium. Then the prize went to Cerulean, a shade of blue that captured both the excitement and anxieties presented by a new decade.</p>
	
	<p>Explains Laurie Pressman, VP of the Pantone Color Institute: <em>&#8220;From now and then [1999], there&#8217;s the same feeling of trepidation in our global culture. From an emotional, psychological standpoint, blue has always represented a certain amount of calm and dependability.&#8221;</em></p>
	
	<p>She continues: <em>&#8220;Blue is a colour that you can rely on.&#8221;</em> And in <em>&#8220;a time that requires trust and faith and confidence&#8221;</em>, it offers <em>&#8220;an anchoring foundation on which to build as we cross the threshold into a new era.&#8221;</em></p>
