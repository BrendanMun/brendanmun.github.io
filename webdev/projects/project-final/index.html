	<h2>Project folders and files</h2>
	<p>Your first step is to create two folders to store the HTML files, CSS files, and images needed for the sample projects.</p>
	<ol>
		<li>If a folder named <b>websites</b> does not already exist on your computer, create it now. </li>
		<li>Download the compressed file for the first sample project to your computer:
		<span class="inside-ol">&nbsp;</span>
		<a href="https://www.munnelly.com/webdev/projects/project-final/zip/project-sample-1.zip">project-sample-1.zip</a>
		<li>Uncompress the ZIP file into a sub-folder of your <b>websites</b> folder named <b>project-sample-1</b>.</li>
		<li>Download the compressed file for the second sample project to your computer:
		<span class="inside-ol">&nbsp;</span>
		<a href="https://www.munnelly.com/webdev/projects/project-final/zip/project-sample-2.zip">project-sample-2.zip</a></li>
		<li>Uncompress the ZIP file into a sub-folder of your <b>websites</b> folder named <b>project-sample-2</b>.</li>
		<li>In File/Windows Explorer, click the <b>index.html</b> files for each of the two projects to open their home web pages with your default web browser. The files will be at the following locations on a Windows PC.
		<span class="inside-ol">&nbsp;</span>
			file:///C:/websites/project-sample-1/index.html
			<span class="inside-ol">&nbsp;</span>
			file:///C:/websites/project-sample-2/index.html
		</li>
	</ol>
	<img src="assets/img/project-folders.png"  alt="How to set up a website">
	<p>Now you can examine and be guided by the files you have downloaded.</p>
</section>

<section id="sample-1" class="block-content bg-white">

	<h2>Sample Project 1: Travel Agency</h2>
	<p>The first sample project is for a fictitious web design and marketing agency. It contains the following three web pages:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>index.html</b>: This contains a large hero background image, with centre-aligned text. Under it is a block of single-column of text, and under that, a three-column layout with images and text.</li>
		<li><b>destinations.html</b>: This contains a large hero background image, also with centre-aligned text. Under it is a single-column text block, and under that, three sections. Each of these sections contains a single-column heading above a four-column layout with images and text.</li>
		<li><b>about-us.html</b>: Another large hero background image, with centre-aligned text, above a block of single-column text. Beneath that are two rows of three columns with images and text.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>For all three pages, the &lt;h1&gt; and &lt;h2&gt; text is animated so that it slides down from the top of the screen.</p>
	

	<p><b>Header</b><br>
	All of the three web pages contain both a desktop and a mobile header, with a logo and a list of menu options in each case.</p>
	<img src="assets/img/sample-header.png"  alt="How to set up a website">

	<ul>
		<li><b>Logo</b>: A 200 x 42 pixels image. Note that the image links to the home page of the website (such as <b>marysmith.github.io/index.html</b>) &#8211; and not to the home page of the three-page sample project.</li>
		<li><b>Menu options</b>: There are three of these. The first menu option links to the <b>index.html</b> page of the three-page sample project &#8211; not to the <b>index.html</b> page of your student website.</li>
		<li><b>Fake button</b>: This is for display only and does not link anywhere.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p><b>Footer</b><br>
	The footer section has the same content on both desktop and mobile screens.</p>
	<img src="assets/img/sample-footer.png"  alt="How to set up a website"><span class="inside-ol">&nbsp;</span>

	<ul>
		<li><b>Links</b>: None of the links are related to the sample web project. They are the same links as are on other pages of your student web site, such the links in the footer of your portfolio and contact pages.</li>
		<li><b>Centre text</b>: This is a short description of the web project.</li>
	</ul>
</section>


<section id="sample-2" class="block-content bg-white">

	<h2>Sample Project 2: Web Design Company</h2>
	<p>The second sample project is for a fictitious web design and marketing company. It contains the following three web pages:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>index.html</b>: This contains a background hero image, with left-aligned text. Under it is a block of single-column of text, and under that, a three-column layout with images and text. The last item on the page above the footer is a single-column block of text.</li>
		<li><b>services.html</b>: This contains a hero background image, also with left-aligned text. Under it is a single-column text block, and under that, two rows of four-column layouts. Each column contains a Font Awesome icon above a small heading. The last item above the footer is a single-column block of text.</li>
		<li><b>team.html</b>: Another background hero image, with left-aligned text, above a block of single-column text. Beneath that is one row of three columns with images and text. Finally, above the footer, is a block with a single column of text.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>For all three pages, the &lt;h1&gt; and &lt;h2&gt; text is animated so that it slides in from the left of the screen.</p>
	
	<p><b>Headers and Footers</b><br>
	The headers (logo and menu options) and footers for this project are similar to those for the first sample project.</p>

</section>


<section id="meta-tags" class="block-content bg-white">
	<h2>Updating the meta tags</h2>
	<p>Before you upload the two sample three-page websites to your account on GitHub, you need to update the details in the &lt;head&gt; sections.</p>

	<p>For each sample website, open the three web pages and, within the <b>&lt;head&gt;</b> section, update the content of the <b>&lt;title&gt;</b> and <b>&lt;author&gt;</b> meta tags with your own name.</p>
	
	<IMG SRC="assets/img/meta-tags.png"  ALT="Project Contact">

	<p>When finished, save the HTML files.</p>

</section>

<section id="google-analytics" class="block-content bg-white">
	<h2>Updating the Google Analytics ID</h2>

	<p>For each sample website, open the three web pages and, within the <b>&lt;head&gt;</b> section, update the Google Analytics Tracking Code.</p>

	<IMG SRC="assets/img/google-analytics.png"  ALT="Project Privacy">

	<p>Each Google Tracking Code has a unique ID in its first and last line. Replace the sample Google Tracking ID with your own Google Tracking ID. The instructions for viewing your website&#8217;s unique Google Tracking ID are <a href="https://munnelly.com/webdev/setting-up-google-analytics.html#google-analytics-view">here</a>.</p>
	
	<p>When finished, save the HTML files.</p>

</section>


<section id="privacy-message" class="block-content bg-white">
	<h2>Adding the privacy pop-up code and message</h2>
	<p>At the bottom of all six HTML files, just before the closing &lt;/body&gt; tag, copy-and-paste the following &#8216;pop-up&#8216; privacy code and message. You can find the instructions for generating this code <a href="https://www.munnelly.com/webdev/projects/project-privacy/index.html#privacy-pop-up-code">here</a>.</p>

	<h2>Uploading the two sample project websites to GitHub</h2>

	<p>After updating the two sample project websites with your own details, the next step is to upload them to your account on GitHub.</p>

	<p>All the files for these two projects are in two sub-folders named <b>project-sample-1</b> and <b>project-sample-2</b> of your <b>websites</b> folder. So you will need to upload these two sub-folders, which contain both files and other sub-folders, to your account on GitHub.</p>

	<p><em>However, GitHub will not allow you to upload only a folder or folders from your computer.</em></p>

	<p>For this reason, you need to upload a file along with your <b>project-sample-1</b> and <b>project-sample-2</b> folders. It can be any file. Follow these steps.</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Sign in to your account at <a href="https://www.github.com" target="_blank">GitHub.com</a>.
		<img SRC="assets/img/github-signin.png" alt="Upload to GitHub"></li>

		<li>On your GitHub home page, click the name of the repository that holds your web pages. Its name will look as follows, where <b>username</b> is your chosen username on GitHub.
		<span class="inside-ol">&nbsp;</span>
		<b>username.github.io</b>
		<span class="inside-ol">&nbsp;</span>
		<img SRC="assets/img/github-repo.png" alt="GitHub Upload"></li>
		
		<li>On the next screen displayed, near the centre of the screen, click the <b>Upload files</b> button.
		<IMG SRC="assets/img/github-centre-options.png" alt="Project Animation Google Fonts"></li>

		<li>On your computer, display your <b>websites</b> folder. You should see that it contains the two sub-folders named <b>project-sample-1</b> and <b>project-sample-2</b>.

		<ul>
			<li>On a Windows computer, click on the <b>project-sample-1</b> folder to select it.
			<span class="inside-ol">&nbsp;</span>
			Next, press and hold down the CTRL key, and then click on the <b>project-sample-2</b> folder to select it.
			<span class="inside-ol">&nbsp;</span>
			Finally, click on any file in your <b>websites</b> folder to select it.</li>
			<li>On an Apple Mac, press and hold down the COMMAND key, and click on the <b>project-sample-1</b> folder to select it.
			<span class="inside-ol">&nbsp;</span>
			Next, click on the <b>project-sample-2</b> folder to select it.
			<span class="inside-ol">&nbsp;</span>
			Finally, click on any file in your <b>websites</b> folder to select it.</li>
		</ul></li>

		<li>Drag-and-drop the <b>project-sample-1</b> and <b>project-sample-2</b> folders and whatever file you have selected to upload them to your GitHub account. In the example below, the file selected along with the two folders is named <b>base-0.html</b>.
		<IMG SRC="assets/img/final-folder-files.png" alt="Project Animation Google Fonts">
		You do not need to select this particular file. You can use any file. But you cannot upload the two folders on their own.</li>

		<li>After uploading the two folders and your selected file, scroll down to the bottom of the GitHub screen, enter a short message in the <b>Commit changes</b> box, click the <b>Commit changes</b> button, and wait for the upload to complete.
		<IMG SRC="assets/img/contact-upload-check-0.png" alt="Project Setup"></li>

		<li>Your main repository screen should now contain two folders named <b>project-sample-1</b> and <b>project-sample-2</b>.
		<IMG SRC="assets/img/final-upload-check-0.png" alt="Project Animation Google Fonts"></li>
	</ol>

	<p>The web pages of the two sample projects will display correctly online only when:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>All the required files are uploaded to GitHub.</li>
		<li>All the files are present in their correct folders and sub-folders on GitHub.</li>
	</ul>


	<p>The two sample projects are now published on GitHub at web addresses similar to the following, where <b>username</b> is the username you have chosen for your GitHub account:</p>
	
	<p><b>https://username.github.io/project-sample-1/index.html</b><br>
	<b>https://username.github.io/project-sample-2/index.html</b></p>

	<p>or, simply</p>
	<p><b>https://username.github.io/project-sample-1</b><br>
	<b>https://username.github.io/project-sample-2</b></p>

	<p>It may take a few minutes for your uploaded files to appear on GitHub.</p>
