                <h2>Creating your folder structure</h2>
                <p>Before creating any web pages, it&#8217;s a good idea to create a location on your computer to store them.</p>

                <p>Working with web pages is very different to working with Microsoft Word or Adobe Photoshop. With those apps, you are typically working with only a <i>single</i> file at any one time.</p>

                <p>In contrast, web pages can contain lots of files. There is the web page itself (an HTML file), one or more stylesheets (CSS files), several images (JPG or PNG files) and maybe some JavaScript code (JS files) and videos (MP4 files) as well.</p>

                <p>That‚Äôs a lot of files to keep track of!</p>

                <p>Moreover, any one website will commonly contain multiple web pages, and each of these will have its own list of images and other files.</p>


                <h3 id="websites-folder">Creating your ‚Äòmain‚Äô folder</h3>
                <p>Your first step is to create a  üìÅ folder on your computer to store all your web design work &#8211; all your files and sub-folders. You can think of this as your &#8216;main&#8217; or &#8216;high-level&#8217; folder.</p>

                <p>For Microsoft Windows users, here are the steps:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Open <b>File Explorer</b>.</li>
                    <li>In the left-hand column, click either on <b>Documents</b> or your <b>C:</b> drive.
                    <img src="assets/img/working-with-html/folder-files-1.png" alt="Introduction to HTML"></li>
                    <li>On the next screen displayed, in the blank space at the right side, right-click and choose <b>New | New folder</b> from the context menu.
                    <img src="assets/img/working-with-html/folder-files-2.png" alt="Introduction to HTML" style="max-width: 500px"></li>
                    <li>Give your new folder a name. For example, <b>websites</b>.
                    <img src="assets/img/working-with-html/folder-files-3.png" alt="Introduction to HTML">
                    <div class="box-warning">
                        <div>
                            <img src="assets/img/working-with-html/warning-sign.png" alt="Introduction to HTML">
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <p><span>DO NOT</span> type upper-case letters. Type <b>websites</b>.</p>
                            <p><span>DO NOT</span> type 'Websites' or 'WEBSITES'.</p>
                            <p><span>DO NOT</span> type blank spaces such as 'web sites'.</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </li>
                </ol>

                <p>‚úÖ &nbsp;That‚Äôs it. In future, you will never need to wonder where your web-related files are located on your computer ‚Äì they will always be in your üìÅ <b>websites</b> folder.</p>

                <h3 id="exercises-folder">Creating your ‚Äòexercises‚Äô sub-folder</h3>

                <p>Creating your ‚Äòmain‚Äô  üìÅ <b>websites</b> folder is only a first step. You will be working with many dozens of files in this course. To keep your files organised, you will be creating a number of sub-folders. And many of these will, in turn, contain sub-folders of their own.</p>

                <p>Follow these steps to create a sub-folder to store the exercise files you will work with in this and the next few Tutorials.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>In Windows, open <b>File Explorer</b>.</li>
                    <li>Select and display your  üìÅ <b>websites</b> folder.</li>
                    <li>In the blank space at the right side, right-click and choose <b>New | New folder</b> from the context menu.</li>
                    <li>Give your new sub-folder this name:
                    <span class="inside-ol">&nbsp;</span>
                    <b>exercises</b>
                    <span class="inside-ol">&nbsp;</span>
                    <div class="box-warning">
                        <div>
                            <img src="assets/img/working-with-html/warning-sign.png" alt="Introduction to HTML">
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <p><span>DO NOT</span> type upper-case letters. Type <b>exercises</b>.</p>
                            <p><span>DO NOT</span> type 'Exercises' or 'EXERCISES'.</p>
                        </div>
                    </div></li>
                </ol>
            <p>‚úÖ &nbsp;All done. Your folder and sub-folder structure should now look as shown below.</p>
            <img src="assets/img/working-with-html/folder-files-4.png" alt="Introduction to HTML" style="max-width: 600px">

            <h3 id="filename-extensions">Viewing the full names of files</h3>
            <p>You will find it easier to work with the various types of files you will meet in web design when you can see the <i>full name</i> of each file.</p>

            <p>By default, the Finder on Apple Macs shows the name of every file in full.</p>

            <p>Microsoft Windows, however, hides the second part of file names, known as the <i>file name extension</i>.</p>

            <img src="assets/img/working-with-html/file-name-extensions.png" alt="Introduction to HTML" style="max-width: 500px">

            <p>Follow the steps below to view file name extensions in Windows 11.</p>

			<ol>
				<li>Open <b>File Explorer</b>.</li>
				<li>Click the <b>View</b> menu and then the <b>Show</b> command.</li>
                <li>From the sub-menu now displayed, select the <b>File name extensions</b> option.
                <img src="assets/img/working-with-html/file-name-3.png" style="max-width: 400px" alt="project in web browser"></li>
			</ol>

            <p>And here are the steps for Windows 10:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Open <b>File Explorer</b>.</li>
                <li>In the menu at the top of the screen, click the <b>View</b> option.
                <img src="assets/img/working-with-html/file-name-1.png" alt="project in web browser"></li>
				<li>You are now shown a new ribbon of options. Check the box named <b>File name extensions</b>.
				<img src="assets/img/working-with-html/file-name-2.png" class="wider-115" alt="project in web browser"></li>
			</ol>

            <p>‚úÖ &nbsp;In future, all files will shown with their full file name that includes the file name extension.</p>

            <h3 id="pin-taskbar">Pinning File Explorer to your Windows Taskbar</h3>
            <p>If you are using Windows, you can add <b>File Explorer</b> to the Taskbar along the bottom of your Windows desktop. You can then launch it at any time with a single click.</p>
            <p>Follow these steps:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>In the Search Box at the left of the Taskbar, enter "File Explorer" (without quotes).

                <img src="assets/img/working-with-html/folder-files-4a.png" alt="Pin applications to Windows Taskbar"></li>
                <li>When the <b>File Explorer</b> icon is displayed in the list of search results, right-click on it.</li>
                <li>Choose <b>Pin to taskbar</b> from the list of options displayed.
                <img src="assets/img/working-with-html/folder-files-5.png" alt="Pin applications to Windows Taskbar"></li>
            </ol>
            <p>In future, when you need to launch <b>File Explorer</b>, you can simply click its icon on the Taskbar.</p>
            <img src="assets/img/working-with-html/folder-files-6.png" class="no-margin-top" alt="Windows Taskbar icons">

            <p>‚úÖ &nbsp;Another task completed. You are now ready to create your first web pages.</p>

        <h2>Creating your first web page</h2>
        <p>You are now ready to create a new web page ‚Äì that is, an  HTML file. Here are the steps:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Start Microsoft Visual Code (VS Code) on your computer.
            <img src="assets/img/working-with-html/taskbar-vscode.png" alt="Introduction to HTML"></li>
            <li>Choose the <b>File | New File</b> command.
            <img src="assets/img/working-with-html/file-new.png" alt="Introduction to HTML">
            VS Code creates a new, empty file in a new tab within your VS Code window.
            <span class="inside-ol">&nbsp;</span>
            It suggests the name of <b>Untitled-1</b> for your new file.

            Let‚Äôs give your file a new name and save it as an HTML file.</li>

            <li>Choose the <b>File | Save As...</b> command.
            <img src="assets/img/working-with-html/file-save-as.png" alt="Introduction to HTML"></li>
            <li>In the dialog box now displayed, save your file in the  üìÅ <b>exercises</b> sub-folder of your  üìÅ <b>websites</b> folder with this name:
            <span class="inside-ol">&nbsp;</span>
            <b>page-1.html</b>
            <span class="inside-ol">&nbsp;</span>

            <div class="box-warning">

                    <p>And <span>DO NOT</span> use some other combination of upper and lower-case letters, such as <b>PAGE-1.HTML</b> or <b>page-1.HTML</b>.</p>

                    <p>Also, <span>DO NOT</span> enter any blank spaces in the name of your file: type <b>page-1.html</b> <span>NOT</span> <b>page - 1.html</b> or <b>page -1.html</b>.</p>

            <img src="assets/img/working-with-html/file-save-as-name-3.png" alt="Introduction to HTML">
            Because you have included the file name extension (<b>.html</b>), you can ignore the second box named <b>Save as type</b>.

            <span class="inside-ol">&nbsp;</span>
            After typing the name of your file, click the <b>Save</b> button.
            <span class="inside-ol">&nbsp;</span>
            Notice how VS Code now displays the name of your <b>page-1.html</b> file at the top of the screen.

                <p>Visual Studio Code offers a convenient shortcut for doing this.</p>

                <ol>

                    <li>In VS Code, click anywhere in your empty web page and type the exclamation mark <b>!</b> (<kbd class="tutorial-key">Shift</kbd> key and number <kbd class="tutorial-key">1</kbd> key).

                        <p>It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair.</p>

                        <p>We had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way - in short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.</p>

                        <p>Small Heading<br>
                        There were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a plain face, on the throne of England; there were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a fair face, on the throne of France. In both countries it was clearer than crystal to the lords of the State preserves of loaves and fishes, that things in general were settled for ever.</p>

                        <p>Small Heading<br>
                        All these things, and a thousand like them, came to pass in and close upon the dear old year one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five. Environed by them, while the Woodman and the Farmer worked unheeded, those two of the large jaws, and those other two of the plain and the fair faces, trod with stir enough, and carried their divine rights with a high hand.</p>

                        <p>Smaller Heading<br>
                        A wonderful fact to reflect upon, that every human creature is constituted to be that profound secret and mystery to every other. A solemn consideration, when I enter a great city by night, that every one of those darkly clustered houses encloses its own secret; that every room in every one of them encloses its own secret; that every beating heart in the hundreds of thousands of breasts there, is, in some of its imaginings, a secret to the heart nearest it!</p>

            <h2>Adding comments to HTML code</h2>

            <p>In a web page, a <i>comment</i> is one or more lines of text that are visible only in the source code ‚Äì but are not actually displayed in the web browser.</p>

            <p>You can see an example of a short, one-line comment below.</p>


<pre class="language-html">  <span class="token comment">&lt;!-- This is a comment --&gt;</span>
</pre>

            <p>And here is an example of a longer, multi-line comment.</p>

<pre class="language-html" style="padding-bottom:0">  <span class="token comment">&lt;!--

        <p>Follow these steps to create a comment in VS Code.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Type a left angle bracket (<b>&lt;</b>), an exclamation mark (<b>!</b>) and two dashes (<b>--</b>).
            <span class="inside-ol">&nbsp;</span>
            The is the opening part of the comment tag.</li>
            <li>VS Code automatically adds the closing part of the comment tag:  two dashes (<b>--</b>) and a right angle bracket (<b>&gt;</b>).

        </ul>

        <p>By default, VS Code displays comments in a dark green colour.</p>

            <h2>Hiding a web page from search engines</h2>

            <p>Google and other search engines use software programs called <i>spiders</i> to <i>crawl</i> the web for web pages to add to their list of indexed web pages. Only web pages listed in such an index will appear in search engine results.</p>

            <p>If you don't want a particular web page to be found by Google or other search engines, follow these steps:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Open your web page in VS Code.</li>

                <li>In the <span class="syn">&lt;head&gt;</span> of your web page add the following new line:
<pre class="language-html">&lt;<span class="blue-dark">meta</span> <span class="blue-light">name</span>=<span class="brown">"robots"</span> <span class="blue-light">content</span>=<span class="brown">"noindex"</span>&gt;
</pre>

                You can add this anywhere within the head. Typically, it is placed just after the charset line, as shown below.
                <img src="assets/img/working-with-html/hide-from-google.png" alt="Introduction to HTML" class="wider-115"></li>
                <li>When finished, save your web page.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Uploading your web pages to GitHub</h2>

            <p>Your final task is to upload your two web pages to your account on GitHub.</p>

            <ol>

                <li>Open a new tab in your web browser and go to <a href="https://www.github.com" target="_blank">GitHub.com</a>. If you are not already signed in to your GitHub account, sign in now.
                <img src="assets/img/working-with-html/github-signin.png" alt="github-signin"></li>

                <li>On your GitHub home page, click the name of the repository (‚Äòrepo‚Äô) that holds your web pages. Its name will look as follows, where <b>username</b> is your chosen username on GitHub.
                <span class="inside-ol">&nbsp;</span>
                <b>username.github.io</b>

                <img src="assets/img/working-with-html/github-repo-select.png" alt="github-signin"></li>

                <li>On the next GitHub screen displayed, near the right of the screen, you can see a button named <b>Add file</b>. Click on it.
                <img src="assets/img/working-with-html/github-btn-add-file.png" alt="github-upload-portfolio"></li>

                <li>From the dropdown list displayed, choose the option <b>Upload files</b>.

                <img src="assets/img/working-with-html/github-btn-add-file-dropdown.png" alt="Project Animation Google Fonts"></li>

                <li>In File Explorer (Windows) or Finder (Apple Mac), drag-and-drop your  <b>index.html</b> file and your üìÅ <b>exercises</b> sub-folder to upload them to your repository on GitHub.
                <img src="assets/img/working-with-html/github-upload-folder-files.png" alt="Introduction to HTML">
                </li>

                <li>Scroll down to the bottom of the GitHub screen, and accept or edit the short message (<span style="color:gray">Add files via upload</span>) in the <b>Commit changes</b> box.</li>

                <li>Finally, click the green <b>Commit changes</b> button to upload your files.
                    <img src="assets/img/working-with-html/github-upload-progress.png" alt="Project Animation Google Fonts"></li>
            </ol>

            <p>Your web pages are now published on GitHub at web addresses similar to the following, where <b>username</b> is the username you have chosen for your GitHub account:</p>

            <p><b>https://username.github.io/index.html</b><br>
                &#8211; or simply &#8211;<br>
            <b>https://username.github.io</b><br>
            <b>https://username.github.io/exercises/page-1.html</b></p>

            <p>It may take a few minutes for your uploaded files to appear on GitHub.</p>
