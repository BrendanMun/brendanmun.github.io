	<h2>Decision-making with <i>if</i></h2>

	<p>Can computers make decisions? Or can they do only what they are told?</p>
	
	<p>The answer to both questions is: 'Yes'. </p>
	
	<p>A computer can make decisions if that's what the software tells it to do. In JavaScript, as in other programming and scripting languages, the <span class="syn">if</span> keyword is at the basis of most decision-making. The code structure is as follows:</p>

<pre class="language-html">
if (condition is true) {
    <i>perform some instruction(s)</i>;
}</pre>

	<p>Note the following points about the <i>if</i> code structure:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>The statement begins with the keyword <span class="syn">if</span> &#8211; not IF or If or iF.</li>
		<li>The condition tested by the <span class="syn">if</span> statement is enclosed within parenthesis ().</li>
		<li>The statement that is performed if the condition is true is written inside a pair of opening and closing curly braces { }.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>What is meant by the word 'condition' In this context, a condition is a combination of :</p>

	<ul>
		<li>A literal value or variable, or two variables, and</li>
		<li>An operator such as 'equal to' or 'greater than' that defines the relationship between the two.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>The <span>if</span> statement in action</h3>

	<p>Consider the following example that tests the value in the variable named 'temperature'. If the value in the variable exceeds a certain amount, the condition is satisfied and the script shows an alert box. The right angle bracket (<b>&gt;</b>) is the JavaScript <i>greater than</i> operator.</p>

<pre class="language-html">
let temperature = 21;
if (temperature &gt; 15) {
    window.alert("Temperature is greater than 15 degrees");
}</pre>

	<p>Here are some other possible conditions that a script could test. The first example tests if the temperature variable is <i>less than</i> the value of 15.</p>

<pre class="language-html">
if (temperature &lt; 15)
</pre>

	<p>The condition below tests if the temperature variable is <i>equal to</i> the value of 15.</p>

<pre class="language-html">
if (temperature == 15)
</pre>

	<p>The next example tests if the temperature variable is <i>greater than or equal to</i> the value of 15.</p>

<pre class="language-html">
if (temperature &gt;= 15)
</pre>

	<p>This example below tests if the temperature variable is <i>less than or equal to</i> the value of 15.</p>

<pre class="language-html">
if (temperature &lt;= 15)
</pre>

	<p>Finally, the example below tests if the temperature variable is <i>not equal</i> to the value of 15.</p>

<pre class="language-html">
if ( temperature != 15)
</pre>

	<p>In Exercise 7.1 you will create a simple script that accepts a user-entered number in a window.prompt() box, assigns it to a variable, tests the value of a variable, and writes a text message to a <span class="syn">window.alert()</span> box if the variable satisfies a particular condition.</p>

	<h3>Exercise 7.1: Using a simple <i>if</i> statement</h3>

	<p>Open the following file in VS Code and web browser:</p>

	<p><a href="exercises/7/exercise-7-1.html" target="_blank">exercise-7-1.html</a></p>

	<p>After the opening <span class="syn">&lt;script&gt;</span> tag enter the following code.</p>

<pre class="language-html">
let userNumber;
userNumber = window.prompt(&quot;Please enter a number between 1 and 100.&quot;);
</pre>

	<p>Beneath the above two lines enter the following <span class="syn">if</span> statement.</p>

<pre class="language-html">
if (userNumber &lt; 50 ) {
    window.alert(&quot;Your entered number is less than 50.&quot;);
}</pre>

	<p>Save your web page and view it in your web browser.</p>

	<p>Enter a number less than 50 (say, 25) in the box when prompted, click <b>OK</b>, and note the result shown in the dialog box.</p>

	<p>
	<img src="assets/img/conditional/7-1.png" alt="JavaScript" style="max-width: 470px"></p>

	<p>You can close the <b>exercise-7-1.html</b> file when finished.</p>

<h2>Comparison operators</h2>

	<p>When testing a condition in JavaScript a comparison operator is used to make some kind of comparison between two values. The following table describes the main comparison operators.</p>

	<table class="table-gray">
		<tr>
			<td><p><b>Operator Symbol</b></p></td>
			<td><p><b>Description</b></p></td>
	 </tr>
		<tr>
			<td><p><b>==</b></p></td>
			<td><p>Tests if the two values are the same.</p></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><p><b>!=</b></p></td>
			<td><p>Tests if the two values are not the same.</p></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><p><b>&gt;</b></p></td>
			<td><p>Tests if the first value is greater than the second.</p></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><p><b>&gt;=</b></p></td>
			<td><p>Tests if the first value is greater than or equal to the second.</p></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><p><b>&lt;</b></p></td>
			<td><p>Tests if the first value is less than the second.</p></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><p><b>&lt;=</b></p></td>
			<td><p>Tests if the first value is less than or equal to the second.</p></td>
		</tr>
	</table>

	<p class="defhead">Comparison Operator</p>

	<p class="deftext">An operator that can compare two values. Such operators are typically used to control script flow as part of <i>if</i> statements.</p>

	<h3>Handling more than one condition</h3>

	<p>A limitation of the script you created in Exercise 7.1 is that it provides feedback to the web page visitor only when the entered a number that is less than the tested value &#8211; that is, when the number is less than 50.</p>
	
	<p>It is good practice to provide user feedback in <i>all</i> situations.</p>

	<p>One way to do this is to combine an <span class="syn">if</span> command with the <span class="syn">else if</span> command in a single JavaScript code block. You can then evaluate more than two possible outcomes.</p>

	<p>Here is a basic example.</p>

<pre class="language-html">
if (first condition true) {
   <i>perform first instruction</i>;
}
		
else if (second condition true) {
   <i>perform second other instruction</i>;
}</pre>
		

	<p>In Exercise 7.2 you will improve the script in the first exercise by adding an <span class="syn">else if</span> branch.</p>

	<h3>Exercise 7.2: Using the <i>if</i> and <i>else if</i> structure</h3>

	<p>Open the following file in VS Code and your web browser:</p>

	<p><a href="exercises/7/exercise-7-2.html" target="_blank">exercise-7-2.html</a></p>

	<p>It is a script similar to the one you created in the previous exercise and contains a single <span class="syn">if</span> statement.</p>

	<p>However, it now contains <i>two</i> instructions to display a window.alert() box, each one with a different message.</p>

<pre class="language-html">
if (userNumber &lt; 50 ) {
    window.alert(&quot;Your entered number is less than 50.&quot;);
}

else if (userNumber &gt; 50 ) {
    window.alert(&quot;Your entered number is greater than 50.&quot;);
}</pre>

<p>What happens if a visitor to the web page enters the number '50'?</p>

<p>To handle this situation, add a second <span class="syn">else if</span> statement to cope with this situation.</p>

<p>Your complete code block should now look as shown below.</p>

<pre class="language-html">
if (userNumber &lt; 50 ) {
    window.alert(&quot;Your entered number is less than 50.&quot;);
}

else if (userNumber &gt; 50 ) {
    window.alert(&quot;Your entered number is greater than 50.&quot;);
}

else if (userNumber == 50 ) {
    window.alert(&quot;Your entered number is exactly 50.&quot;);
}</pre>

	<p>Save your web page and view it in your web browser.</p>

	<p>Test your script by entering various numbers between 1 and 100 in the box when prompted, click <b>OK</b>, and note the results displayed in the window.alert() box.</p>

	<p> <img src="assets/img/conditional/7-2.png" alt="JavaScript"> </p>
	
	<p>You can close the <b>exercise-7.2.html</b> file when finished.</p>

<h2>The all-purpose <i>else</i> command</h2>

<p>If you have ever organised physical items in a room or workplace you probably ended up with a drawer or shelf called 'miscellaneous' or 'other stuff'.</p>


<p>Similarly, there are many scripting situations where no amount of <span class="syn">if</span> and <span class="syn">else if</span> statements is enough to cope with every possible value that may be entered by a web page visitor.</p>

<p>The remedy is to use the <span class="syn">else</span> command. This is JavaScript's way of handling values that fall in the category of 'other' or 'miscellaneous'.</p>

<p>The general form of the <span class="syn">if</span>, <span class="syn">if else</span> and <span class="syn">else</span> decision-making structure is as follows.</p>

<pre class="language-html">
if (condition is true) {
    <i>perform first instruction;</i>
}

else if (condition is true) {
    <i>perform second instruction;</i>
}

else {
    <i>perform some other instruction</i>;
}</pre>

<h3>Exercise 7.3: Using the <i>else</i> command</h3>

<p>In VS Code and your web browser, open the following file:</p>

<p><a href="exercises/7/exercise-7-3.html" target="_blank">exercise-7-3.html</a></p>

<p>The script works as follows:</p>
<ul>

	<li>Web page visitors are prompted to type their country name in a text box.</li>

	<li>Your code assigns the entered country name to a variable named 'userCountry'.
<pre class="language-html">
  let userCountry = document.getElementById("countryName").value;
</pre></li>

	<li>The code declares a variable named 'userGreeting' and stores the appropriate greeting text with a flag emoji character in it.
<pre class="language-html">
   let userGreeting;

if userCountry == "France") {
   userGreeting = "🇫🇷 &nbsp;Bonjour";
}
		 
else if userCountry == "Germany") {
   userGreeting = "🇩🇪 &nbsp;Guten tag";
}
		 
else if userCountry == "Italy") {
   userGreeting = "🇮🇹 &nbsp;Ciao";
}</pre></li>

	<li>At the bottom of the web page is an <i>event listener</i> that connects the user action of clicking the button (id of <b>btnUserCountry</b>) with calling the function (name of <b>userCountryGreeting</b>)</li>

	<li>Your web page displays the appropriate greeting in the div tag with an <b>id</b> of <b>resultBox</b> response.
<pre class="language-html">
  document.getElementById("resultBox").innerHTML = userGreeting;
</pre></li>
</ul>

<p>The code is perfectly valid. Try it in your web browser to verify that it runs without error.</p> 

<p> <img src="assets/img/conditional/7-3.png" alt="JavaScript"> </p>

<p>But what if someone enters the name of a country that is not one of the above &#8211; that is, not Italy, Germany or France?</p>

<p>The script has no way of handling that situation.</p>


<p>In this example, insert the following code <i>after</i> the final <span class="syn">else if</span> statement.</p>

<pre class="language-html">
else {
   userGreeting = "🌎 &nbsp;Wherever you are from, welcome to my website";
}</pre>

<p>Save the file in VS Code, and run it in your web browser. Verify that your <span class="syn">else</span> statement is working correctly.</p>

<p> <img src="assets/img/conditional/7-4.png" alt="JavaScript"> </p>

<p>You can close the <b>exercise-7.3.html</b> file when finished.</p>
</section>

<section >

<h2>Linking conditions with logical operators</h2>

<p>There are times when one condition is not enough. You can join multiple conditions together to form a single statement using the so-called <i>logical operator</i>s. </p>
	
<p>The following code tests both temperature and humidity with the AND (<span class="syn">&amp;&amp;</span>) operator.</p>

<pre class="language-html">
let temperature = 21;
let humidity = 61;
if ( (temperature &gt; 20) &amp;&amp; (humidity &gt; 60) ) {
   console.log("Temperature and humidity conditions are met");
}</pre>

<p>The following code uses the OR (<span class="syn">||</span>) operator and is satisfied if either one condition <i>or</i> both conditions are met. </p>

<pre class="language-html">
let temperature = 19;
let humidity = 61;
if ( (temperature &gt; 20) || (humidity &gt; 60) ) {
   console.log("Yes. One or both are met" );
}</pre>

<p>Copy each of the above two code blocks to your web browser DevTools console and view the output.</p>

<p>The following table describes the two logical operators.</p>

<table class="table-gray">

	<tr>
		<td style="width:30%"><p><b>Operator Symbol</b></p></td>
		<td style="width:60%"><p><b>Description</b></p></td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
		<td style="width:30%"><p>&amp;&amp;</p></td>
		<td style="width:60%"><p>The <b>AND</b> operator. Joins multiple conditions in such a way that the output is true only if all the individual conditions are true.<br><br></p></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td style="width:30%"><p>||</p></td>
		<td style="width:60%"><p>The <b>OR</b> operator. Joins multiple conditions in such a way that the output is true if any one (or more or all) of the individual conditions is true.</p></td>
	</tr>

</table>

<p class="defhead">Logical Operator</p>

<p class="deftext">An operator that can compare two values. Such operators typically used to control script flow as part of if statements.</p>

<p>In Exercise 7.4 you will use the AND logical operator to test the username and password entered by a web page visitor. Please note that is script is only for demonstration. It is <i>not</i> secure because the correct values are visible to anyone who reads the script.</p>

<h3>Exercise 7.4: Building a simple user access web page</h3>

<p>Open the following file in VS Code and your web browser:</p>

<p><a href="exercises/7/exercise-7-4.html" target="_blank">exercise-7-4.html</a></p>

<p> <img src="assets/img/conditional/7-5.png" alt="JavaScript"> </p>

<p>In the file is a function named <b>checkUser()</b> that contains only comments.</p>
	
<p>You can also see two required input fields ( <b>inputEmail</b> and <b>inputPwd</b> ), a div element (id of <b>resultBox</b> ) for displaying an output message, a button (id of <b>btnSignin</b>) and an event listener.</p>

<p>Inside the function, insert the following variable declarations and comments.</p>

<pre class="language-html">
// Declare variables
let userEmail = "patrick99@dogemail.com"; // from database
let userPwd = "abc123"; // from database
let message;
</pre>

<p>Next, insert the following statements that assign the user-entered field values to JavaScript variables.</p>

<pre class="language-html">
// Assign user inputs to variables
let inputEmail = document.getElementById("inputEmail").value;
let inputPwd   = document.getElementById("inputPwd").value;
</pre>

<p>Insert the following <span class="syn">if&#8230;else</span> structure with the <span class="syn">&&</span> statement.</p>

<pre class="language-html">
// Test if both inputs correct 
if ( (inputEmail == userEmail) && (inputPwd == userPwd) ) {
   message = "✅ &nbsp;Details correct. Please continue."
}

// Oops. One or both inputs incorrect
else {
   message = "❌ &nbsp;Details incorrect. Please try again."
}
document.getElementById("resultBox").innerHTML = message;</pre>

<p>Save your web page and view it in your web browser.</p>

<p>Test your script by entering various combinations of correct and incorrect usernames and passwords. You can close the file when finished.</p>


<p>In Exercise 7.5 you will use the <span class="syn">if else</span> structure in combination with an AND  <span class="syn">&&</span> operator to improve the script you created in Exercise 7.2.</p>

<h3>Exercise 7.5: Improving your user input test web page</h3>

<p>Open the following file in VS Code and web browser:</p>

<p><a href="exercises/7/exercise-7-5.html" target="_blank">exercise-7-5.html</a></p>

<p>It is a script similar to the one you created in Exercise 7.2. Visitors to this web page are asked to enter a number in the range 1 to 100, and the script can display one of three messages in response.</p>

<p>But what if someone enters 110, 456768 or -24.4?</p>

<p>As a first step. insert a new <span class="syn">if</span> statement before the existing one as shown below.</p>

<pre class="language-html">
if ( (userNumber &lt; 0 ) || (userNumber &gt; 100 ) ) {
   window.alert(&quot;Your entered number is not within the allowed range.&quot;);
}</pre>

<p>Next, change what was the first <span class="syn">if</span> statement to an <span class="syn">else if</span>statement, as shown below.</p>

<pre class="language-html">
else if (userNumber &lt; 50 ) {
   window.alert("Your entered number is less than 50.");
}
</pre>

<p>Save your web page and view it in your web browser.</p>

<p>Test your new code by enter numbers less than 1 and greater than 100.</p>

<p>Try entering a number that contains a comma separator (such as 12,500) and note that the script does not respond. That is because such a number is treated as a string.</p>

<p>You can close the <b>exercise-7-5.html</b> file when finished.</p>

	<h2>Lesson Summary</h2>

	<p>In JavaScript as in other programming and scripting languages the <span class="syn">if</span> command is at the basis of most decision-making. The syntax is as follows:</p>

<pre class="language-html">if (condition is true) {
  perform instruction;
}
</pre>

<p>The condition can include a literal value, a variable, or two with comparison operator such as ‘equal to’ or ‘greater than’ that defines the relationship between the two. For situations where multiple <span class="syn">if</span> statements cannot cope with all possible variable values, JavaScript provides an <span class="syn">else</span> command. Its syntax is as follows.</p>

<pre class="language-html">if (condition is true) {
   perform instruction;
}
else {
   perform other instruction;
}</pre>

<p>You can join multiple conditions together to form a single statement using the so-called logical operators, AND (<span class="syn">&&</span>) and OR (<span class="syn">||</span>). An alternative to using one or more if commands, perhaps ending with a ‘catch all’ else command, is provided by the <span class="syn">else if</span> command. The general syntax is as follows.</p>

<pre class="language-html">
if (first condition true) {
   perform first instruction;
}
else if (second condition true) {
   perform second other instruction;
}
else if (third condition true) {
   perform third instruction;
}
else {
   perform some other instruction;
}
