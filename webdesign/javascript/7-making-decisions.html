	<h2>Decision-making with <i>if</i></h2>

	<p>Can computers make decisions? Or can they do only what they are told?</p>
	
	<p>The answer to both questions is: 'Yes'. </p>
	
	<p>A computer can make decisions if that's what the software tells it to do. In JavaScript as in other programming and scripting languages the <span class="syn">if</span> keyword is at the basis of most decision-making. The code structure is as follows:</p>

<pre class="language-html">
if (condition is true) {
    <i>perform some instruction(s)</i>;
}</pre>

	<p>Note the following points about the <i>if</i> code structure:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>The statement begins with the keyword <span class="syn">if</span> &#8211; not IF or If or iF.</li>
		<li>The condition tested by the <span class="syn">if</span> statement is enclosed within parenthesis ().</li>
		<li>The statement that is performed if the condition is true is written inside a pair of opening and closing curly braces {}.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>What is meant by the word 'condition' In this context, a condition is a combination of :</p>

	<ul>
		<li>A literal value or variable, or two variables, and</li>
		<li>An operator such as 'equal to' or 'greater than' that defines the relationship between the two.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>The <span>if</span> statement in action</h3>

	<p>Consider the following example that tests the value in the variable named 'temperature'. If the value in the variable exceeds a certain amount, the condition is met and the script shows an alert box. The right angle bracket (<b>&gt;</b>) is the JavaScript <i>greater than</i> operator.</p>

<pre class="language-html">
const temperature = 21;
if (temperature &gt; 15) {
    window.alert("Temperature is greater than 15 degrees");
}</pre>

	<p>Here are some other possible conditions that a script could test. The first example tests if the temperature variable is <i>less than</i> the value of 15.</p>

<pre class="language-html">
if (temperature &lt; 15)
</pre>

	<p>The condition below tests if the temperature variable is <i>equal to</i> the value of 15.</p>

<pre class="language-html">
if (temperature == 15)
</pre>

	<p>The next example tests if the temperature variable is <i>greater than or equal to</i> the value of 15.</p>

<pre class="language-html">
if (temperature &gt;= 15)
</pre>

	<p>This example below tests if the temperature variable is <i>less than or equal to</i> than the value of 15.</p>

<pre class="language-html">
if (temperature &lt;= 15)
</pre>

	<p>Finally, the example below tests if the temperature variable is <i>not equal</i> to the value of 15.</p>

<pre class="language-html">
if ( temperature !=	15)
</pre>

	<p>In Exercise 7.1 you will create a simple script that accepts a user-entered number in a window.prompt() box, assigns it to a variable, tests the value of a variable, and writes a text message to a <span class="syn">window.alert()</span> box if the variable satisfies a particular condition.</p>

	<h3>Exercise 7.1: Using a simple <i>if</i> statement</h3>

	<p>Open the following file in VS Code and web browser:</p>

	<p><a href="exercises/7/exercise-7-1.html" target="_blank">exercise-7-1.html</a></p>

	<p>After the opening &lt;script&gt; tag enter the following code.</p>

<pre class="language-html">
var userNumber;
userNumber = window.prompt(&quot;Please enter a number between 1 and 100.&quot;,&quot;&quot;);
</pre>

	<p>Beneath the above two lines enter the following <i>if</i> statement.</p>

<pre class="language-html">
if (userNumber &lt; 50 ){
    window.alert(&quot;Your entered number is less than 50.&quot;);
}</pre>

	<p>Save your web page and view it in your web browser.</p>

	<p>Enter text in the box when prompted, click <b>OK</b>, and note that the result shown in the dialog box.</p>

<h2>Comparison operators</h2>

	<p>When testing a condition in JavaScript a comparison operator is used to make some kind of comparison between two values. The following table describes the main comparison operators.</p>

	<table class="table-gray">
		<tr>
			<td><p><b>Operator Symbol</b></p></td>
			<td><p><b>Description</b></p></td>
	 </tr>
		<tr>
			<td><p><b>==</b></p></td>
			<td><p>Tests if the two values are the same.</p></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><p><b>!=</b></p></td>
			<td><p>Tests if the two values are not the same.</p></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><p><b>&gt;</b></p></td>
			<td><p>Tests if the first value is greater than the second.</p></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><p><b>&gt;=</b></p></td>
			<td><p>Tests if the first value is greater than of equal to the second.</p></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><p><b>&lt;</b></p></td>
			<td><p>Tests if the first value is less than the second.</p></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><p><b>&lt;=</b></p></td>
			<td><p>Tests if the first value is less than of equal to the second.</p></td>
		</tr>
	</table>

	<p class="defhead">Comparison Operator</p>

	<p class="deftext">An operator that can compare two values. Such operators are typically used to control script flow as part of <i>if</i> statements.</p>

	<h3>Multiple <i>if</i> Commands</h3>

	<p>A limitation of the script you created in Exercise 7.1 is that it provides feedback to the web page visitor only when the entered a number that is less than the tested value &#8211; that is, when the number is less than 50. It is good practice to provide user feedback in <i>all</i> situations.</p>

	<p>In Exercise 7.2 you will improve the script by adding a second <i>if</i> command. </p>

	<h3>Exercise 7.2: Using a Multiple <i>if</i> Structure</h3>

	<p>Open the following file in VS Code and web browser:</p>

	<p><a href="exercises/7/exercise-7-2.html" target="_blank">exercise-7-2.html</a></p>

	<p>It is a script similar to the one you created in the previous exercise, and contains a single <i>if</i> command.</p>

	<p>Add a second if command beneath the first as shown below. It too contains an instruction to display a window.alert() box, but with a different message.</p>

<pre class="language-html">
if (userNumber &lt; 50 ) {
    window.alert(&quot;Your entered number is less than 50.&quot;);
if (userNumber &gt; 50 ) {
    window.alert(&quot;Your entered number is greater than 50.&quot;);
}</pre>

<p>What happens if a visitor to the web page enters the number '50'? Add a third <i>if</i> command and associated statement to cope with this situation as follows.</p>

<pre class="language-html">
if (userNumber &lt; 50 ) {
    window.alert(&quot;Your entered number is less than 50.&quot;);
}

if (userNumber &gt; 50 ) {
    window.alert(&quot;Your entered number is greater than 50.&quot;);
}

if (userNumber == 50 ) {
    window.alert(&quot;Your entered number is exactly 50.&quot;);
}</pre>

	<p>Save your web page and view it in your web browser.</p>

	<p>Test your script by entering various numbers in the box when prompted, click <b>OK</b>, and note the results displayed in the window.alert() box. You can close the file when finished.</p>

<h2>The all-purpose <i>else</i> command</h2>

<p>If you have ever organised physical items in a room or workplace you probably ended up with a drawer or shelf called 'miscellaneous' or 'other stuff'. Similarly, there are many scripting situations where no amount of <i>if</i> statements is enough to cope with every possible value that may be entered by a web page visitor. Consider the following example:</p>

<ul>

	<li>You create a web page that prompts visitors to type their country name in a text box.

	<img src="assets/img/image1.gif"></li>

	<li>Your script assigns the entered country name to a variable named 'country'.

<pre class="language-html">
var country = document.forms.myform.T1.value;
</pre></li>

	<li>Your web page displays an appropriate greeting in response.
<pre class="language-html">
if country == "Italy") {
    window.alert("Ciao");
}

if country == "Germany") {
    window.alert("Guten tag");
}

if country == "France") {
    window.alert("Bonjour");
}</pre></li>
</ul>

<p>The code is perfectly valid. But what if someone enters the name of a country that is not one of the above &#8211; that is, not Italy, Germany or France? The script has no ways of handling that situation.</p>

<p>The remedy is to use the <i>else</i> command. This is JavaScript's way handling values that fall in the category of 'other' or 'miscellaneous'.</p>

<p>In this example you could insert the following code <i>after</i> the multiple if statements.</p>

<pre class="language-html">
else {
    window.alert("Wherever you are from , welcome to my website");
}</pre>

<p>The general form of the <i>if�else</i> decision-making structure is as follows.</p>

<pre class="language-html">
if (condition is true) {
    <i>perform some instruction;</i>
}

else {
    <i>perform other instruction</i>;
}</pre>

</section>

<section >

<h2>Linking conditions with logical operators</h2>

<p>There are times when one condition is not enough. You can join multiple conditions together to form a single statement using the so-called <i>logical operator</i>s. The following code tests both temperature and humidity with the AND (&amp;&amp;) operator.</p>

<pre class="language-html">
var temperature = 21;
var humidity = 61;
if ( (temperature &gt; ) &amp;&amp;( humidify &gt;) ) {
    window.alert("Temperature and humidity conditions are met");
}</pre>

<p>The following code is satisfied if eithef one condition or both conditions are met. </p>

<pre class="language-html">
var temperature = 21;
var humidity = 61;
if ( (temperature &gt;) || (humidity &lt;) ) {
    window.alert("Yes. One or both are met" );
}</pre>

<p>The following table describes the two logical operators.</p>

<table>
	<tr>
		<td><p><b>Operator Symbol</b></p></td>
		<td><p><b>Description</b></p></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><p>&amp;&amp;</p></td>
		<td><p>The AND operator. Joins multiple conditions in such a way that the output is true only if all the individual conditions are true.</p></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><p>||</p></td>
		<td><p>The OR operator. Joins multiple conditions in such a way that the output is true if any one (of more or all) of the individual conditions is true.</p></td>
	</tr>
</table>

<p class="defhead">Logical Operator</p>

<p class="deftext">An operator that can compare two values. Such operators typically used to control script flow as part of if statements.</p>

<p>In Exercise 7.3 you will use the AND logical operator to test the username and password entered by a web page visitor. Please note that is script is only for demonstration. It is <i>not</i> secure because the correct values are visible to anyone who reads the script.</p>

<h3>Exercise 7.3: Building a Simple User Access Web Page</h3>

<p>Open the following file in VS Code and web browser:</p>

<p><a href="exercises/7/exercise-7-3.html" target="_blank">exercise-7-3.html</a></p>

<p>In the document head is a function named checkUser() that contains only comments. In the document body are a button with an event handler, and three text boxes The first two are for user input. The third is for displaying feedback messages.</p>

<p>Insert the following variable declarations.</p>

<pre class="language-html">
/* Declare variables */
var userName = &quot;patrick99&quot;;
var userPwd = &quot;tulip&quot;;
var inputName;
var inputPwd;
var message;
</pre>

<p>Insert the following statements that assign user-entered form field values to JavaScript variables.</p>

<pre class="language-html">
/* Assign forms inputs to variables */
inputName = document.forms.myform.T1.value;
inputPwd = document.forms.myform.T2.value;
</pre>

<p>Insert the following <i>if&#8230;else</i> structure with the <i>and</i> statement.</p>

<pre class="language-html">
/* Test if inputs correct */
if ( (inputName == userName) &amp;&amp; (inputPwd == userPwd) ) {
    message = &quot;Details correct. Please continue.&quot;
    document.forms.myform.T3.value=message;
}

/* If inputs incorrect */
else {
    message = &quot;Details incorrect. Please try again.&quot;
    document.forms.myform.T3.value=message;
}</pre>

<p>Save your web page and view it in your web browser.</p>

<p>Test your script by entering various combinations of correct and incorrect usernames and passwords. You can close the file when finished.</p>

<p>
<img src="assets/img/image116.jpg"></p>

<p>In Exercise 7.4 you will use the <i>if&#8230;else</i> structure in combination with an AND operator to improve the script you created in Exercise 5.2.</p>

<h3>Exercise 7.4: Building an User Input Test Web Page</h3>

<p>Open the following file in VS Code and web browser:</p>

<p><a href="exercises/7/exercise-7-4.html" target="_blank">exercise-7-4.html</a></p>

<p>It is a script similar to the one you created in Exercise 5.2, and contains multiple <i>if</i> commands. Visitors to this web page are asked to enter a number in the range 1 to 100, and the script can display one of three messages in response.</p>

<p>But what if someone enters 110, 456768 or -24.4?</p>

<p>Insert a new <i>if</i> statement before the existing ones as shown.</p>

<pre class="language-html">
userNumber =window.prompt(&quot;Please enter a number between 1 and 100.&quot;,&quot;&quot;);
if ( (userNumber &lt; 0 ) || (userNumber &gt;0 ) ) {
    window.alert(&quot;Your entered number is not within the allowed range.&quot;);
}</pre>

<p>Save your web page and view it in your web browser.</p>

<p>When the window.prompt()
box is displayed, type a number greater than 100. Notice that the script responds by displaying not one but <i>two</i>window.alert()
boxes in turn.</p>

<img src="assets/img/image118.jpg">

<img src="assets/img/image120.jpg">

<p>What went wrong? Nothing: your script is behaving exactly as you told it. The entered number satisfies two of 
the <i>if</i> statements. In addition to satisfying the new statement that you inserted in Step 2 of this Exercise, it also meets the condition set out in the following statement. That is why your scripts displays the sequence of twowindow.alert() boxes.</p>

<pre class="language-html">
if (userNumber &gt; 50 ) {
    window.alert(&quot;your entered number is greater than 50.&quot;);
}</pre>

<p>For your script to operate sensibly, edit the above <i>if</i> statement as follows.</p>

<pre class="language-html">
if (userNumber &gt; 50) &amp;&amp; (userNumber &lt;= 100) {
    window.alert(&quot;Your entered number is greater than 50.&quot;);
}</pre>

<p>One more change to make" edit the 'less than 50' <i>if</i> statement so that it correctly responds to the entry of a negative number to a window.prompt()
box.</p>

<pre class="language-html">
if ( (userNumber &lt; 50 ) &amp;&amp;(userNumber &gt;= 0 ) ) {
    window.alert(&quot;Your entered number is less than 50.&quot;);
}</pre>

<p>Resave your file, and refresh/reload your web browser. Verify that your script can now respond appropriately to the input of numbers less than 0 and greater than 100. Try entering a number that contains a comma separator (such as 12,500) and note that the script does not respond. That is because such a number is treated as a string. You can close the file when finished.</p>

	<h2>The alternative <i>else if</i> approach</h2>

	<p>A series of <i>if</i> commands, perhaps combined with logical AND or OR operators, and typically ending with a 'catch all' <i>else</i> command, can cope with every decision-making requirement that you are likely to ask JavaScript to perform. There is a closely-related alternative approach, however, that is provided by the <i>else if</i> command. The general syntax is as follows.</p>

<pre class="language-html">
if (first condition true) {
    <i>perform first instruction</i>;
}

else if (second condition true) {
    <i>perform second other instruction</i>;
}

else if (third condition true) {
    <i>perform third instruction</i>;
}

else {
    <i>perform some other instruction</i>;
}</pre>

<p>Is there any difference between a series of <i>if</i> commands which might with an <i>else</i> command, and one <i>if</i> command, a series of <i>else if</i> commands, and a perhaps a final <i>else</i> command? </p>

<p>Not really.</p>

<p>They both perform the same job. The difference lies in the scripting logic: a series of <i>if</i> statements is considered by JavaScript as a series of separate, individual statements, while an <i>if</i> followed by a number of <i>else if</i> commands is regarded as one, large, single command.</p>

<p>In Exercise 7.5 you will rewrite the script you created in Exercise 7.4 to include a series of <i>else if</i> commands.</p>

<h3>Exercise 7.5: Using an <i>else if</i> Structure</h3>

<p>Open the following file in VS Code and web browser:</p>

<p><a href="exercises/7/exercise-7-5.html" target="_blank">exercise-7-5.html</a></p>

<p>It is a script similar to the one you created in Exercise 7.4, and contains multiple <i>if</i> commands.</p>

<p>Replace the second, third and forth <i>if</i> commands with <i>else if</i> commands as shown below.</p>

<pre class="language-html">
else if ( (usernumber &lt; ) &amp;&amp; (userNumber &gt;= 0 ) ) {
    window.alert(&quot;Your entered number is less than 50.&quot;);
}

else if ( (usernumber &gt; ) &amp;&amp; (userNumber &lt;= 100 ) ) {
    window.alert(&quot;Your entered number is greater than 50.&quot;);
}

else if (userNumber == 50 ) {
    window.alert(&quot;Your entered number is exactly 50.&quot;);
}</pre>

<p>Save your web page and view it in your web browser.</p>

<p>Verify that your script can respond appropriately to user input. You can close the file when finished.</p>
