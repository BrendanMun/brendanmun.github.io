	<h2>Going On and On: JavaScript Loops</h2>

	<p>The word 'loop' suggests a circle. Similarly, the term 'looping' in a script implies that an instruction or set of instructions that repeat forever. Well, looping can mean that. But only if the loop is written incorrectly.</p>

	<p>Properly used, a loop is a very useful programming structure that repeats an instruction or series of instructions when certain conditions are satisfied, and then <i>stops</i>. JavaScript offers three types of loops:</p>

	<ul>
		<li><b>The <i>for</i> loop</b>: This is the most common loop in JavaScript, and the one that offers the most control to the JavaScript programmer. Use this loop when:</li>

		<li>You know in advance how many times you want the loop to repeat, and</li> 
		<li>You want the loop condition tested before the loop runs.</li>

		<li><b>The <i>while</i> loop</b>: This is JavaScript's simplest loop structure. Use a <i>while</i> loop when:</li>

		<li>You don't know in advance how many times you want the loop to repeat, but</li>

		<li>You want the loop condition tested before the loop runs.</li>

		<li><b>The <i>do-while</i> loop</b>: A variation on the <i>while</i> loop. Use this loop when:</li>

		<li>You don't know in advance how many times you want the loop to repeat, and</li>

		<li>You don't want the loop condition tested before the loop runs.</li>

		<li>Unlike the similar-sounding <i>while</i> loop the <i>do..</i><i>while</i> loop is always performed at least once, because JavaScript tests the required condition only after the first loop occurrence.</li>

	</ul>

	<p class="defhead">JavaScript Loop</p>

	<p class="deftext">A script that performs a statement or series of statements repeatedly until a certain condition is satisfied. The loop then stops and the next statement in the script after the loop is performed.</p>

</section>

<section id="loop-conditions">
	<h3>About Loop Conditions</h3>

	<p>Every loop type contains some kind of condition statement. As with the <i>if</i> command, condition statements in loops include comparison operators such as greater than (&gt;) and equal to (==).</p>

	<ul>
		<li>When the condition is tested and satisfied, the loop runs.</li>
		<li>After every time that the loop runs, it tests the condition again. The loop will keep repeating until the condition is no longer satisfied.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Before discovering more about these loop types and putting your knowledge in practice, you need to learn about two new assignment operators: increment (++) and decrement (--).</p>

</section>


<section id="increment-decrement">

	<h3>About the Increment and Decrement Operators</h3>

	<p>In programming the word 'increment' means 'make larger by one' and its converse of 'decrement' means 'make smaller by one'. You have met only one type of assignment operator so far, an example of which is shown below. </p>

<pre class="language-html">
myvar = 42;
</pre>

	<p>As you can see it has two terms, one on each side of the equals (=) sign. Below are examples of the increment and decrement operators. These contain only a single term and do not require an equals sign.</p>

<pre class="language-html">
firstNumber++;
/* Above has the same effect as writing firstNumber = firstNumber + 1 */
secondNumber--;
/* Above has the same effect as writing firstNumber = firstNumber - 1 */
</pre>

	<p>These operators work only with numeric variables. They are really just a convenient shorthand notation. Now let's move on to the <i>for</i> looping structure.</p>

</section>


<section id="for-loop-structure">

	<h2>The <i>for</i> Loop Structure</h2>

	<p>A basic <i>for</i> loop in JavaScript would look as shown below.</p>

<pre class="language-html">
for (i=1;i&lt;=5;i++) {
    <i>perform instruction(s );</i>
}</pre>

	<p>Let's examine each element in detail.</p>

	<ul>
		<li><b>for</b>: Always type 'for', not 'FOR' of 'For'. The <i>for</i> command name is case sensitive.</li>

		<li><b>i</b>: Every loop has a <i>counter variable</i> 		that keeps track of how many times the loop has been performed. By convention, the counter variable is designated by the lower-case letter 'i'. Some programmers prefer the letter 'n', while others use the word 'count' or 'counter'.</li>

		<li><b>i=1</b>: The loop has to start somewhere. In this example the starting point is when the counter variable has a value of 1. It could also be 12, 56 or -78.</li>

		<li><b>i&lt;=5</b>: You don't want a loop to run indefinitely, so you set an upper limit. In this case, the loop stops when the counter variable reaches the number 5.</li>

		<li><b>i++</b>: This tells JavaScript to add 1 repeatedly to the counter variable until the variable reaches the upper loop limit (in this case, 5). It does not have to be the increment operator. A loop can contain the decrement operator, i--.</li>

	</ul>

	<p>Programmers use a special term to describe the performance of a loop: iteration.</p>

	<p class="defhead">Iteration</p>

	<p class="deftext">A single performance of a loop. If a loop runs fives it is said to have done five iterations.</p>

	<p class="defhead">Loop Counter Variable</p>

	<p class="deftext">The variable in a loop structure that keep track of how many loop iterations have been performed. The variable is typically named 'i'. Alternative names include 'n', 'count' or 'counter'.</p>

	<p>In Exercise 8.1 you will create a simple <i>for</i> loop structure.</p>

	<h3>Exercise 8.1: Building a Simple <i>for</i> Loop</h3>

	<p>Open the following file in your VS Code and web browser:</p>

	<p><a href="assets/exercises/loops/exercise-8-1.html" target="_blank">exercise-8-1.html</a></p>

	<p>After the opening &lt;script&gt; tag type the following <i>for</i> lop structure</p>

<pre class="language-html">
&lt;scripts&gt;
var i;
for (i=1;i&lt;=5;i++)
document.write(&quot;this is loop step number: &quot;+i+&quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;);
}</pre>

	<p>Save your web page  and view it in your web browser.</p>

	<p>The result should look as shown.</p>

	<p><img src="assets/img/image124.jpg"></p>

	<p>Edit the loop code as shown below, reSave your web page, and refresh/reload your web browser. </p>

<pre class="language-html">
&lt;script&gt;
for (var i=-1; i&gt;=-5;i--)
</pre>

	<p>The result should look as shown. You can close the file when finished.</p>

<section id="more-for-loop">
	<h3>More About <i>for</i> Loops</h3>

	<p>Here are three points to remember about the <i>for</i> loop structure in JavaScript:</p>

	<ul>
		<li><b>Initial and upper values</b>: Unlike the other two loop types, the initial and upper values of a <i>for</i> loop are included within the loop structure itself. These do not have to be literals, such as '3' or '-42'. They can also be variables whose values come from 
		elsewhere in the script or from a user input. For example:

<pre class="language-html">
for ( i=baseTemperature; i &lt;= userTemperature;i++);
</pre></li>

	<li>In the Other two loop types, the initial and upper values are not including in the loop structure, but always come from other statements in the script.</li>

	<li><b>Curly braces</b>: The <i>for</i> loop does not require curly braches {} if the loop contains only a single instruction. You can include them if you want: they won't cause an error; they are just unnecessary. If the loop contains multiple instructions they must be enclosed within curly braces. 


<pre class="language-html">
for ( var i=1;
i&lt;=5;i++) {
document.write(&quot;this is the loop step number: &quot;+i+&quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;);
document.write(&quot;this is the loop step multiplied by 4: &quot;+i*4+&quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;);
document.write(&quot;this is the loop step divided by 2: &quot;+i/2+&quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;);
document.write(&quot;Still looping&lt;br&gt;&quot;);
}</pre>
By convention loop statements are indented. This is for one reason only: to make them easier to read.</li>

	<li><b>Statement terminator</b>: Do not type a semi-colon after the loop condition as shown below. This will produce an error.</li>
</ul>

	<p>The general syntax of a <i>for</i> loop is shown below.</p>

<pre class="language-html">
for (initialisation;condition statement;countef variable update) {
<i>statements(s) containing counter variable;�</i>
}</pre>

	<p>In Exercise 8.2 you will create a simple <i>for</i> loop in which the number of iterations is not a fixed literal by a variable value input by the web page visitor.</p>

	<h3>Exercise 8.2: Building a User-controlled <i>for</i> Loop</h3>

	<p>Open the following file in your VS Code and web browser:</p>

	<p><a href="assets/exercises/loops/exercise-8-2.html" target="_blank">exercise-8-2.html</a></p>

	<p>It is similar to the incrementing loop that you worked on in the previous exercise.</p>

	<p>After the opening &lt;script&gt; tag type the following window.prompt() statement on a single line.</p>

<pre class="language-html">
var userCount = window.prompt(&quot;Please enter your desired number of loop steps&quot;,&quot;&quot;);
</pre>

	<p>Edit the loop command as follows.</p>

<pre class="language-html">
for (var i=1;i&lt;=userCount;i++)
</pre>

	<p>Save your web page  and view it in your web browser.</p>

	<p>Type a positive number in the window.prompt() box, click <b>OK</b> and view the output in the web browser window. You can close the file when finished.</p>

	<h2>Chapter Summary</h2>

	<p>A <i>loop</i> is a script that performs a statement or series of statements repeatedly until a certain condition is satisfied. The loop then stops and the next statement in the script after the loop is performed. A basic <i>for</i> loop in JavaScript looks as shown below.</p>

<pre class="language-html">
for (i=1;i&lt;=5;i++) {
<i>perform instruction(s );</i>
}</pre>

	<p>Every loop has a <i>counter variable</i> (typically denoted y the letter 'i') that keeps track of how many times the loop has been performed, a starting or <i>initial value</i>, an <i>upper limit</i>, and an <i>increment</i> (i++) or <i>decrement</i> (i--) operator that increases or decreases the loop counter variable by one on each <i>iteration</i> of the loop. The <i>for</i> loop does not require curly braches {} if the loop contains only a single instruction. If the loop contains multiple instructions they must be enclosed within curly braces.</p>

	<p>In each loop the initial loop counter value is set outside the loop and not within it. The test condition is enclosed within parenthesis, the statement(s) to be performed are enclosed within curly braces, as is the increment or decrement operator. </p>

	<p>All three JavaScript loops can include <i>break</i> and/or <i>continue</i> commands with the ability to interrupt loops when the counter variables reaches a certain value. The <i>break</i> command tells JavaScript that, when the counter variable reaches a specified value, to exit the loop, and move on the next statement in the script after the loop. The <i>break</i> command comes before the statement(s) that are performed within the loop.</p>

	<p>The <i>continue</i> command also interrupts the running of a loop, but it the message it sends to JavaScript is slightly different: when the counter variable reaches a specified value, don't perform the statement(s) in the loop, but return to the top of the loop as if all the statements have been performed. The loop then continues on as normal. You typically use the <i>continue</i> 	command to handle special or exceptional values of the counter variable.</p>
