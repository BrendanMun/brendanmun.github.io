      <h6>565 North Service Road (Waterview Condos)</h6><p>Waterview Condominiums consists of two high rise buildings in two phases. I entered the project when Phase 1 was breaking ground and Phase 2 was going through site plan approval for an additional six stories from the original design. SPA was completed by ICON while the construction drawing were given to a drafting company called TechniCAD. I was tasked with minor revisions for resubmission if site plan approval (co-ordinating with building permit drawings from techniCAD, creation of black line drawings for marketing purposes and review of building permit/construction drawings).</p>

  <div>
      <h6>5451 Lakeshore Road (Parkview)</h6><p>5451 Lakeshore road was a development with seven high-end regular townhouse units. The narrow lot size only permitted an entry/exit lane with one block of townhouses. The townhouses were larger in square footage than a typical townhouse and were specified with higher quality materials. I had taken over the submission of the site plan approval while also creating a set of drawings for building permit submission. Construction details were created by referencing previous construction drawings from ICON and TechniCAD.</p>

      <h6>U.C. Towns Development</h6><p>U.C. Towns is a joint project in Oshawa, Ontario. Canada with ICON Architects and Cassidy and Company. The three phase project consists of multiple blocks of six-eight townhouse units. The buildings were four stories in height which is not permitted in single family homes; a code consultant filed a code report to the city of Oshawa with additional code requirements to ensure the safety of the occupants in the proposed buildings. ICON’s role was to review/stamp the drawings that Cassidy and CO. had created for submission and to perform monthly site visits with final reviews to permit occupancy.</p>

      <h6>219-227 Major Mackenzie Drive East</h6><p>Major Mackenzie was a small development consisting of two blocks: both blocks totaled a number of eleven townhouses. The project was nearing completion of site plan approval when I was tasked to create the working drawings for building permit submission. Creation of detail and wall assemblies required minor changes to layout designs for permit. Cladding research and foundation details in coordination with structure had also altered the exterior look of the buildings. Collaboration with structural and mechanical teams were needed to take the permit drawings to near completion.</p>

      <h6>Toronto of the Future Exhibition</h6><p>The Toronto of the Future exhibition was an exhibition for new and upcoming projects in the Greater Toronto Area. Projects could be displayed in either video, panel design and/or model. The partners at ICON Architects had placed me in charge of coordinating with the exhibition team and creating/printing the panel designs. The panels were six feet in height and four feet in width. The projects chosen for each display were high rise developments at 39-97 Carrville Road and 9218 Yonge Street. Renderings were created using shaded light and then completed on adobe photoshop.</p>

      <h6><u>THE BORDER</u></h6>
      <p>The project seeks to embody aspects of the fundamental unfinalisability at the heart of human interaction and creation. The basis for exploration is the paradoxical relationship between the self and the other, that we are all “subjects in incompleteness.” This dialogue between self and other has necessary components and useless components. Much like human emotion, understanding can be only to a certain degree: some parts are never understood. An acceptance of these unfinished aspects of human understanding reduces frustration. </p>
      </div>
      <img class="arch-d" src="../assets/images/architecture/03-archives-of-unfinished-work/web/vingette.jpg" alt="Vingette">
      <div class="arch-e">
      <h6><u>INTERVENTIONS</u></h6>
      <p>The project for an archives of unfinished plays, music and dance, connects these themes with the human creative processes. It does not store failed attempts, but lost aspirations. As a sort of  architectural sphinx, the project plays with the disposes of their own potential; it leads them in random directions, changes the exit paths and forces reflection upon those storing the incomplete creative work. It also plays with the lost potential of the creative work, inviting (partial) completion by others, and exposing the result to the elements and the eyes of the world.
      <br><br>
      The concept drawing above focuses boundaries. There is visually more interaction at the boundary. This represents the conflict between self and other; an example could be ones own ideals versus the world's current state or a conflict between two characters. An important aspect of the drawing is that although there is interaction and conflict at the border, the basic essence of self and other is virtually the same.</p>

      <h6><u>ARCHITECTURAL CONCEPT: WEAVING</u></h6><br><p>A current issue with immigration in Canada is a lack of immigrants’ integration with current societies, communities and technologies of contemporary Canada. Whether an immigrant decides to move to Canada for cultural integration, a wealthy lifestyle or other reasons, full integration will increase the progress of the individual and the community.</p><br>
      <p>The goal to be achieved is full (while respecting cultures and beliefs) integration into a society. This raised the idea of weaving; weaving two or more strands, fabrics or materials elegantly  into a uniform fabric. The fabric creates a unified entity while maintaining its individual elements; there is a vast amount of connections in a fabric. This is the cause of its appeal and structure.</p>

      <h6><u>THE PROGRAM</u></h6><p>The goal of this project is to create a research centre for the town of Almonte in Ontario, Canada. The type of research project was the choice of the student; my research centre is built for the purpose of developing urban wind turbines due to many issues with large commercial turbines placed around rural areas. Almonte is a small town with a potential to grow. This mirrors the current state of urban designed renewable energy.</p><br>
      <p>Issues associated with commercial wind turbines include gears in the generators malfunctioning, birds being killed by turning blades, disturbance of people and animals (from noise and shadow movement) and falling ice debris during winter season. Due to these issues, the constant goal of this proposed research building is to maximize efficiency and reduce disturbance issues of urban wind turbines which would reduce the demand of commercial turbines.</p>
