				<h2>JavaScript and synchronous execution</h2>

				<p>Because JavaScript is a single-threaded programming language with a synchronous execution model, it can process only one operation at a time, and one operation after the other.</p>
				
				<p>However, as a developer you will want to perform some actions that may take a long and perhaps unknown time to complete. For example, requesting data from a remote server.</p>
				
				<p><i>How can you prevent such tasks from blocking all other actions, such as accepting user input, clicking a button, or scrolling?</i></p>

				<p>A number of solutions have evolved to support asynchronous (&#8216;parallel&#8217;) coding in JavaScript. We will explore the first two in this Lesson.</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li><b>Web APIs</b>: These are strictly not part of JavaScript but of the web browser. One such is the <span class="syn-js">setTimeOut()</span> method which we can use to mimic the reaction of a slow-to-respond remote server.</li>
					<li><b>Callback functions</b>: In simple terms, a function that is passed as an argument to another function and then executes inside that outer or parent function.</li>
					<li><b>Promises</b>: Objects that manage the execution of tasks in a synchronous manner. <a href="../26-promises/index.html">See this Lesson</a>.</li>
					<li><b>async/await functions</b>: The most modern and easiest way to implement Promise objects. <a href="../27-async-await/index.html">See this Lesson</a>.</li>
				</ul>
			</section>

			<section id="js-nested">
					
				<h2>Nested functions</h2>

				<p>A first step in understanding asynchronous execution in JavaScript is to recognise that JavaScript supports <i>nested functions</i>. That is, functions located inside other functions.</p>

				<p>An outer function is referred to as <i>parent function</i>, and the inner function(s) as <i>child function(s)</i>. The basic syntax is as follows.</p>

<pre><code><span class="comment">// Create outer function</span>
function <span class="highlight">parentFunction ()</span> {
    <span class="comment">// Create inner function</span>
    function <span class="highlight">childFunction ()</span> {
        <span class="comment">// Body of the child function</span>
    } <span class="comment">// End of child function</span>
    <span class="comment">// Call child function</span>
    <span class="highlight">childFunction()</span>;
} <span class="comment">// End of parent function</span>
	
<span class="comment">// Call parent function</span>
<span class="highlight">parentFunction()</span>;</code></pre>

			<p>Note the following:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>The <span class="syn-js">childFunction()</span> is defined inside the <span class="syn-js">parentFunction()</span>.</li>
				<li>When you want to invoke the <span class="syn-js">childFunction()</span>, we have to call it within the body of the <span class="syn-js">parentFunction()</span>.</li>
				<li>The variables and parameters of the parent function are accessible to the child function(s).</li>
				<li>But parent function cannot access the variables declared inside the child function(s).</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>Copy the following sample code of a nested function to your <b>exercises-callback-functions.html</b> file and place inside <span class="syn">script</span> tags.</p>


<pre><button class="copy-code" id="btn-1">Copy code <i class="fa-brands fa-square-js"></i></button><code id="strCode-1">function <span class="highlight">addNum(</span>x,y<span class="highlight">)</span> {
    <span class="comment">// nested function</span>
    function <span class="highlight">showMessage(</span>text<span class="highlight">)</span> {
        console.log(text);
    }
    const sum = x + y;
    <span class="comment">// call the nested function</span>
    <span class="highlight">showMessage(</span>`The sum is: ${sum}`<span class="highlight">)</span>;
}

<span class="highlight">addNum(</span>5,6<span class="highlight">)</span>;
</code></pre>

			<p>When you run the above code, you will see the following output in the console.</p>

		</section>			

		<section id="js-order">


				<h2>Order of function execution</h2>
				<p>Unless it is using an asynchronous Web API, JavaScript code executes in a synchronous, sequential, one-step-at-time manner. In particular, functions are executed in the order they are called. </p>
				
				<p>Copy the following example of three functions to your exercise file.</p>
					
<pre><button class="copy-code" id="btn-2">Copy code <i class="fa-brands fa-square-js"></i></button><code id="strCode-2"><span class="comment">// Create three functions</span>
function <span class="highlight">first()</span> {
    console.log("1");
}
		
function <span class="highlight">second()</span> {
    console.log("2");
}

function <span class="highlight">third()</span> {
    console.log("3");
}

<span class="comment">// Call the three functions</span>
<span class="highlight">first()</span>;
<span class="highlight">second()</span>;
<span class="highlight">third()</span>;</code></pre>
					
	<p>In your web browser console you will see the output shown below. As expected, the three functions run in the same order as they were called.</p>
					
<pre><code>Output
1
2
3</code></pre>

			</section>

			<section id="js-settimeout">

				<h2>The <code>setTimeOut()</code> async method</h2>

				<p>Web browsers include a number of built-in APIs that enable some tasks to run asynchronously, so that they do not block or 'freeze' broswer while they are running.</p>
			
				<p>One such is the <span class="syn-js">setTimeout()</span> method, which allows you to execute a piece of code after a certain amount of time has passed. You can use this to simulate a request to a slow-to-respond remote server. Its basic syntax is as follows:</p>

<pre><code><span class="yellow">setTimeout(</span><span class="highlight">function</span>, milliseconds<span class="yellow">)</span>;</code></pre>
					
				<p>In the second of your three sample functions, nest the <span class="syn-js">console.log</span> statement inside an arrow function as follows.</p>

<pre><button class="copy-code" id="btn-3">Copy code <i class="fa-brands fa-square-js"></i></button><code id="strCode-3"><span class="comment">// Nest new arrow function inside the second function</span>
function <span class="highlight">second()</span> { <span class="highlight">() =&gt;</span> {
        console.log("2");
    }; <span class="comment">// End of anonymous function statement with ;</span>
} <span class="comment">// End of function declaration expression. No ;</span></code></pre>

		<p>The second function is now really two functions, with an inner child function nested inside an outer parent function.</p>

		<p>Rewrite the inner nested function as an arrow function.</p>

<p>Now wrap the inner nested function inside a <span class="syn-js">setTimeout()</span> with a delay of 5 seconds.</p>

<pre><button class="copy-code" id="btn-4">Copy code <i class="fa-brands fa-square-js"></i></button><code id="strCode-4"><span class="comment">// Nested arrow function inside the second function</span>
<span class="comment">// Wrap arrow function inside a 5 second delay timer</span>
function <span class="highlight">second()</span> {
    <span class="yellow">setTimeout(</span><span class="highlight">() =&gt;</span> {
        <span class="comment">// JavaScript waits 5 seconds before executing the next line</span>
        <span class="comment">// Emulates delayed response from remote server</span>
        console.log("2");
    }, 5000<span class="yellow">);</span>
}</code></pre>
					
		<p>Now, check the console output. It will look as follows.</p>
			
<pre><code>Output
1
3
2</code></pre>

		<p>Whether you set the timeout to 2, 5 or even 0 millseconds will make no difference. The asynchronous code will <i>always</i> execute after the synchronous functions.</p>

		<p>But...</p>
		
		<p>What do we do if the <b>third()</b> depends on the output of the <b>second()</b> function?</p>
		
		<p>How do we get <b>third()</b> to delay execution until after the asynchronous action in <b>third()</b> has completed? This is where callbacks come in.</p>
		
	</section>

	<section id="js-callback">
		
		<h2>About callback functions</h2>
		<p>Instead of executing first, second, and third at the top-level of execution, pass third function as an argument to second. The second function will execute <i>after</i> the asynchronous action has completed.</p>

		<p>Rewrite the three functions as follows.</p>

<pre><button class="copy-code" id="btn-5">Copy code <i class="fa-brands fa-square-js"></i></button><code id="strCode-5"><span class="comment">// Working with three functions</span>
function <span class="highlight">first()</span> {
    console.log("1");
}
					
function <span class="highlight">second(callback)</span> {
    <span class="yellow">setTimeout(</span><span class="highlight">() =&gt;</span> {
        <span class="comment">// JavaScript waits 5 seconds before executing the next line</span>
        <span class="comment">// Emulates delayed response from remote server</span>
        console.log("2");
        <span class="comment">// Execute the callback function below after previous line executed</span>
        callback();
    }, 5000<span class="yellow">);</span> <span class="comment">// Ends inner function wrapped in timer</span> 
} <span class="comment">// Ends outer parent function with parameter</span> 
					
function <span class="highlight">third()</span> {
    console.log("3");
}

<span class="comment">// Call first function directly</span>
<span class="highlight">first()</span>;
<span class="comment">// Call second function with third function passed as argument</span>
<span class="highlight">second(third)</span>;</code></pre>

<p>On running this code block, you will receive the following output:</p>
					
<pre><code>Output
1
2
3</code></pre>

				
		<p>First <b>1</b> will print, and after the timer completes, then <b>2</b> then <b>3</b>.</p>
	

		<p>Note the following:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>You have redefined the second function from just <b>second()</b> to <b>second(callback)</b>. It can now accept an input parameter that, by convention, is named <b>callback</b>.</li>
			<li>The <b>third()</b> function is not called directly from the main thread of code.</li>
			<li>Instead, the <b>third()</b> function is run by passing it as an argument to the <b>second(callback)</b> function.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>In JavaScript, a callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument, which is then invoked inside the outer/paremt function to complete some kind of routine or action.</p>
		
		<p>Callback functions do not have special syntax. Any function can become a callback function if it is passed as an argument. Callbacks are not asynchronous by nature, but can be used with a Web API for asynchronous purposes.</p>

		<p>In the above example, by passing the <b>third()</b> function as a callback, you‚Äôve successfully delayed execution of this function until the asynchronous Web API (setTimeout) completes.</p>
					
<!--		
		<p>Here is a syntactic code example of a higher-order function and a callback:</p>
					
<pre><code>// A function
function fn() {
					  console.log('Just a function')
}
					
// A function that takes another function as an argument
function higherOrderFunction(callback) {
    // When you call a function that is passed as an argument, it is referred to as a callback
    callback()
}
					
// Passing a function
higherOrderFunction(fn)</code></pre>
					
		<p>In this code, you define a function fn, define a function higherOrderFunction that takes a function callback as an argument, and pass fn as a callback to higherOrderFunction.</p>
					
		<p>Running this code will give the following:</p>
					
<pre><code>Output
Just a function</code></pre> -->
					
					
<!--					
		<p>The key takeaway here is that callback functions are not asynchronous‚ÄîsetTimeout is the asynchronous Web API responsible for handling asynchronous tasks. The callback just allows you to be informed of when an asynchronous task has completed and handles the success or failure of the task.</p>
					
		<p>Now that you have learned how to use callbacks to handle asynchronous tasks, the next section explains the problems of nesting too many callbacks and creating a ‚Äúpyramid of doom.‚Äù</p>
					
-->
	</section>

	<section id="pyramid-of-doom">
		<h2>Nested callbacks and the &#8216;Pyramid of Doom&#8217;</h2>
					
		<p>In a practical app, you will want to receive more than one item of data back from a remote server.</p>
		
		<p>You will want to know whether the interaction with the server is pending or complete. If it is complete, whether the request has been successful or not. If successful, you will want the stream of requested data. Or, if unsuccessful, the relevant error message or code.</p>

		<p>In the past, this range of possible return state conditions and values was processed in the JavaScript code using a complex multi-level pyramid of callback functions. This became even more difficult to manage when dealing with a series of consecutive asynchronous requests that relied on each other.</p>

			
		<p>As a result, code containing nested callbacks was referred to as &#8216;callback hell&#8217; or the &#8216;pyramid of doom&#8217;. Hence the introduction of the newer techniques of <a href="../26-promises/index.html">Promises</a> and <a href="../27-async-await/index.html">async/await functions</a>.</p>

		<!--
		This way of handling asynchronous code is difficult to follow. As a result, the concept of promises was introduced in ES6. This is the focus of the next section.
		Promises
		

					This section of the tutorial showed that promises incorporate a lot of improvements for dealing with asynchronous code. But, while using then to handle asynchronous actions is easier to follow than the pyramid of callbacks, some developers still prefer a synchronous format of writing asynchronous code. To address this need,?> ECMAScript 2016 (ES7) introduced async functions and the await keyword to make working with promises easier.
					Async Functions with async/await
					
					An async function allows you to handle asynchronous code in a manner that appears synchronous. async functions still use promises under the hood, but have a more traditional JavaScript syntax. In this section, you will try out examples of this syntax.
					
					You can create an async function by adding the async keyword before a function:
					
					// Create an async function
					async function getUser() {
					  return {}
					}
					
					Although this function is not handling anything asynchronous yet, it behaves differently than a traditional function. If you execute the function, you‚Äôll find that it returns a promise with a [[PromiseStatus]] and [[PromiseValue]] instead of a return value.
					
					Try this out by logging a call to the getUser function:
					
					console.log(getUser())
					
					This will give the following:
					
					Output
					__proto__: Promise
					[[PromiseStatus]]: "fulfilled"
					[[PromiseValue]]: Object
					
					This means you can handle an async function with then in the same way you could handle a promise. Try this out with the following code:
					
					getUser().then((response) =&gt; console.log(response))
					
					This call to getUser passes the return value to an anonymous function that logs the value to the console.
					
					You will receive the following when you run this program:
					
					Output
					{}
					
					An async function can handle a promise called within it using the await operator. await can be used within an async function and will wait until a promise settles before executing the designated code.
					
					With this knowledge, you can rewrite the Fetch request from the last section using async/await as follows:
					
					// Handle fetch with async/await
					async function getUser() {
					  const response = await fetch('https://api.github.com/users/octocat')
					  const data = await response.json()
					
					  console.log(data)
					}
					
					// Execute async function
					getUser()
					
					The await operators here ensure that the data is not logged before the request has populated it with data.
					
					Now the final data can be handled inside the getUser function, without any need for using then. This is the output of logging data:
					
					Output
					login: "octocat",
					id: 583231,
					avatar_url: "https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/583231?v=4"
					blog: "https://github.blog"
					company: "@github"
					followers: 3203
					...
					
					Note: In many environments, async is necessary to use await‚Äîhowever, some new versions of browsers and Node allow using top-level await, which allows you to bypass creating an async function to wrap the await in.
					
					Finally, since you are handling the fulfilled promise within the asynchronous function, you can also handle the error within the function. Instead of using the catch method with then, you will use the try/catch pattern to handle the exception.
					
					Add the following highlighted code:
					
					// Handling success and errors with async/await
					async function getUser() {
					  try {
						// Handle success in try
						const response = await fetch('https://api.github.com/users/octocat')
						const data = await response.json()
					
						console.log(data)
					  } catch (error) {
						// Handle error in catch
						console.error(error)
					  }
					}
					
					The program will now skip to the catch block if it receives an error and log that error to the console.
					
					Modern asynchronous JavaScript code is most often handled with async/await syntax, but it is important to have a working knowledge of how promises work, especially as promises are capable of additional features that cannot be handled with async/await, like combining promises with Promise.all().
					
					Note: async/await can be reproduced by using generators combined with promises to add more flexibility to your code. To learn more, check out our Understanding Generators in JavaScript tutorial.
					
					Because Web APIs often provide data asynchronously, learning how to handle the result of asynchronous actions is an essential part of being a JavaScript developer. In this article, you learned how the host environment uses the event loop to handle the order of execution of code with the stack and queue. You also tried out examples of three ways to handle the success or failure of an asynchronous event, with callbacks, promises, and async/await syntax. Finally, you used the Fetch Web API to handle asynchronous actions.
					
					

				<p>Let's go through a basic example to illustrate how callback functions work:</p>
				
				<p>Suppose you have a function called greet that takes a name and a callback function as arguments. The greet function prints a greeting message, and then it calls the provided callback function.</p>
		
<pre><button class="copy-code" id="btn-1">Copy <i class="fa-solid fa-copy"></i></button><code id="strCode-1">function greet(name, callback) {
    console.log('Hello, ' + name);
    callback();
}</code></pre>
		
		<p>Now, you want to create a callback function called finishedGreeting that will be called after the greeting message is printed.</p>

<pre><button class="copy-code" id="btn-2">Copy <i class="fa-solid fa-copy"></i></button><code id="strCode-2">function finishedGreeting() {
    console.log('Greeting completed.');
}</code></pre>
		
		<p>To use the finishedGreeting function as a callback, you pass it as an argument to the greet function:</p>

<pre><button class="copy-code" id="btn-3">Copy <i class="fa-solid fa-copy"></i></button><code id="strCode-3">greet('John', finishedGreeting);</code></pre>
		
<p>The output will be:</p>
		
<pre><code>Hello, John
Greeting completed.</code></pre>
		
		<p>In this example, finishedGreeting is a callback function that is passed to the greet function. The greet function first prints the greeting message, and then it calls the finishedGreeting function, which in turn prints "Greeting completed."</p>
		
		<p>You can also use anonymous functions as callbacks:</p>
		
<pre><button class="copy-code" id="btn-4">Copy <i class="fa-solid fa-copy"></i></button><code id="strCode-4">greet('John', function() {
    console.log('Greeting completed.');
});</code></pre>
		
		<p>Here, the anonymous function is passed as an argument to the greet function. The greet function first prints the greeting message, and then it calls the anonymous function, which in turn prints "Greeting completed."</p>
