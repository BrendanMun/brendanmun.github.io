	<h1>Email marketing: learning from the greats</h1>

	<p>Have all the great emails already been written? Certainly, a browse through the following showcase of Lionel Messi-grade examples may leave digital marketers wondering: how can I possibly compete with that level of awesomeness?</p>

	<p>What makes these Hall of Email Fame examples stand out is not so much their choice of muted, <a href="https://reallygoodemails.com/emails/give-the-gift-youd-like-to-receive-the-new-york-times/" target="_blank">pastel shades</a> paired with <a href="https://reallygoodemails.com/emails/we-fall-boots/" target="_blank">classical typefaces</a>. Or, alternatively, the brash combination of bright, <a href="https://reallygoodemails.com/emails/happy-holidays-friend/" target="_blank">look-at-me colours</a> and <a href="https://reallygoodemails.com/emails/top-19-of-19/" target="_blank">modern fonts</a>. Sure, great visual design helps. But your first task in drafting any successful marketing email is to answer the question: &#8216;What am I trying to communicate here?&#8217;</p>

	<p>The secret in moving quickly from a blank screen to a ready-to-send email is to recognise that marketing emails fall into one of a number of distinct categories. And each category will have its own set evidence-proven best practices. Are you announcing a shiny new product, for example? Or maybe offering a time-limited discount on an existing one? Or perhaps you have been tasked with sending out an event invitation? What works for one category of email may not work for others.</p>

	<p>For guidance on creating your first draft, check out Bill Widmer&#8217;s excellent blog post on the Sumo website, <a href="https://sumo.com/stories/email-blast-templates/" target="_blank">8 Proven Email Blast Templates For Nearly Any Situation</a>. Bill&#8217;s downloadable templates set out the must-have elements for each category of email. Accompanying every template outline is a fully-worked example. So you can see how the general principles translate into impactful, high-converting emails with real-world subject lines, opening paragraphs, benefit statements and the all-important calls-to-action.</p>

	<p>After getting your first draft into shape, you may find your text could benefit from some prose polishing. That&#8217;s where the <a href="https://www.goodemailcopy.com/" target="_blank">Good Email Copy</a> website can help. There you will find hundreds of best-in-class examples from companies such as Slack, Trello, and WordStream. Hubspot&#8217;s <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/32606/the-9-must-have-components-of-compelling-email-copy.aspx" target="_blank">10 Tips for Writing Compelling Email Copy</a> and Optin Monster&#8217;s <a href="https://optinmonster.com/9-tips-for-writing-email-marketing-copy-that-converts/" target="_blank">17 Tips for Writing Email Marketing Copy that Converts</a> are worth a look, as is <a href="https://www.campaignmonitor.com/blog/email-marketing/2019/06/write-email-copy-that-sells/" target="_blank">How to Write Email Copy That Sells</a> from Campaign Monitor.</p>

	<p>Pro-tip: Good email copy is spell-checked and syntax-checked copy. So, if you have not already signed up for the <a href="https://app.grammarly.com/" target="_blank">Grammarly</a> online service, now is a good time to do so. You&#8217;ll find the free version adequate for most copy-writing tasks.</p>

	<p>On their own, words are rarely enough to convert browsers into customers. For royalty-free stock images, <a href="https://pixabay.com" target="_blank">Pixabay</a>, <a href="https://www.unsplash.com" target="_blank">Unsplash</a> and <a href="https://burst.shopify.com/" target="_blank">Burst</a> from Shopify provide searchable treasure troves of professional-quality photographs. For free-to-use line drawings and illustrations, there&#8217;s the excellent <a href="https://undraw.co" target="_blank">Undraw</a> and the delightful <a href="https://www.humaaans.com" target="_blank">Humaaans</a>.</p>

	<p>Most stock images will be larger than is necessary for display on even the widest desktop or laptop screens. So shrink their widths down to about 1280 pixels or less using one of the many free and easy-to-use online image editing tools. My favourite is <a href="https://www.befunky.com/" target="_blank">BeFunky</a>. After that, compress their file size with <a href="https://tinyjpg.com/"  target="_blank">TinyJPG</a> or similar. Right-sizing and compressing your images will help ensure they load quickly &#8211; or even at all &#8212; on slow Internet connections.</p>

	<p>Your favourite email software probably includes layout tools for assembling email text and visual elements into a finished email. But if you find yourself limited by the options available, or simply feel more adventurous, take a look at the online drag-and-drop email-builder, <a href="https://emailmonster.io/" target="_blank">Email Monster</a>. Multi-column layouts, colours, text sizes, buttons, images, social media icons, embedded videos - this easy-to-use program has it all. And it&#8217;s free to use.</p>
